# Insights Scheduler Service

(WORK IN PROGRESS)

A Go REST API service for programmatic job scheduling using the declarative shell functional core design pattern.

## Features

- **Functional Core** with pure business logic
- **Imperative Shell** for side effects (HTTP, storage, scheduling)
- **CRUD operations** for scheduled jobs
- **Job control endpoints** (run, pause, resume)
- **Standard 5-field cron scheduling**
- **SQLite database storage**
- **Background job execution**

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

2. Build and run the service:
```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

The service will start on `http://localhost:5000` with the scheduler running in the background.

## API Endpoints (Work In Progress)

### Job Management

- `POST /api/scheduler/v1/jobs` - Create a new job
- `GET /api/scheduler/v1/jobs` - Get all jobs (supports ?status= and ?name= filters)
- `GET /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}` - Get specific job
- `PUT /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}` - Update job (full replacement)
- `PATCH /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}` - Partial update job
- `DELETE /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}` - Delete job

### Job Control

- `POST /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}/run` - Run job immediately
- `POST /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}/pause` - Pause job
- `POST /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}/resume` - Resume paused job

### Job Runs

- `GET /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}/runs` - List all runs for a job
- `GET /api/scheduler/v1/jobs/{id}/runs/{run_id}` - Get specific run details

## Job Schema

Jobs are authenticated via the `X-Rh-Identity` header. The `org_id`, `username`, and `user_id` are automatically extracted from this header and not exposed in API responses.

```json
{
  "id": "string (UUID)",
  "name": "string",
  "schedule": "string (5-field cron expression)",
  "type": "string (message|http_request|command|export)",
  "payload": {},
  "status": "string (scheduled|running|paused|failed)",
  "last_run": "string (ISO timestamp)"
}
```

**Note**: The `payload` field can be any valid JSON value (object, array, string, number, boolean, or null). Its structure depends on the job type.

## Schedule Formats

The service accepts standard 5-field cron expressions:
- Format: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`

Common examples:
- `*/10 * * * *` - Every 10 minutes
- `0 * * * *` - Every hour at minute 0
- `0 0 * * *` - Every day at midnight
- `0 0 1 * *` - Every month on the 1st at midnight
- `30 14 * * MON-FRI` - Every weekday at 2:30 PM
- `0 9 * * 1` - Every Monday at 9:00 AM

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
go run cmd/test/main.go
```

Make sure the service is running before executing tests.

## Architecture (Functional Core / Imperative Shell)

### Functional Core (`internal/core/`)
- `domain/` - Pure domain models and validation logic
- `usecases/` - Business logic with dependency interfaces

### Imperative Shell (`internal/shell/`)
- `http/` - HTTP handlers and routing
- `storage/` - In-memory repository implementation
- `scheduler/` - Background scheduling
- `executor/` - Job execution logic

### Entry Points (`cmd/`)
- `server/` - Main application server
- `test/` - API test client
